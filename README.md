Notable labs from my 2018 C Programming Class


## Lab 3
###### lab3DivingCompetitionSimulation.c
Program to simulate a diving competition. There are a random number of divers that compete in 5 rounds. A diver's score for each round is calculated by adding the judge's scores (after removing the highest and lowest scores). After all 5 rounds, the divers with the three highest scores are announced.
